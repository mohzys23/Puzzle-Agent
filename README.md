## 🔥 The Ultimate Challenge

This puzzle represents one of the most difficult 8-puzzle configurations possible:

```
Initial State:        Goal State:
[8, 7, 6]            [1, 2, 3]
[' ', 4, 1]          [4, 5, 6]
[2, 5, 3]            [7, 8, ' ']
```

**Challenge Metrics:**
- **30+ optimal moves** required to solve
- **Extreme computational complexity** - tests algorithm limits
- **Perfect for benchmarking** - separates efficient from inefficient algorithms

## 🧠 Algorithm Comparison

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Optimal solution, massive node exploration
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Memory efficient, may struggle with deep solutions
- **A* Search** - Optimal and efficient using Manhattan distance heuristic
- **Greedy Best-First** - Fastest execution, may find suboptimal solutions

## 🔧 Customization

### Create Custom Puzzles
```python
from utils import PuzzleState

# Define your puzzle
initial_board = [[8, 7, 6], [0, 4, 1], [2, 5, 3]]
goal_board = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]

initial_state = PuzzleState(initial_board)
goal_state = PuzzleState(goal_board)
```

### Use Algorithms Separately
```python
from algorithms import a_star_search, PuzzleState

# Use any algorithm independently
path, nodes, steps, solution = a_star_search(initial_state, goal_state)
```
